# Web-Page-Design-1

A fully finalized website project

This project was a task given to me by my IT development teacher RÃ¸yken VGs. And I started this project by making and sorting all my files and folder and then make reuseable blocks of code to insert in every HTML file to make it much easier to design every part of this project. 

Some examples of the code i reused are:

## Header

   
```
<div class="top-bar">
        <h1><b class="kh">KH </b>Web Design</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="Home.html">HOME</a></li>
        <li><a href="Om Oss.html">OM OSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="Tjenester.html">TJENESTER</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

## Footer

```
<footer>
    <p>KH Web Design, Copyright &copy; 2021</p>
</footer>
```

# Design 

I was given a strict format to follow when it came to how to website was going to look. But i was not given any intructions on how to actually build the website from top to bottom. Naturally, since if i did it wouldn't be much of a "Task" would it? I did the best i could and i belive i ended up with a splendid result in return. 

In my opinion it came out looking like the original then the original. 

# Problems

But with a project this big i was bound to run into some problems along the way. And i surprisingly didn't run into a problem during the designing og the website itself. I actually ran into a problem when i was going to set up GitHub Pages because i had som problems with my repository. Thankfully one of my close friends had run into this problem once before so he gave me an easy fix. 

When this issue was i finally able to upload my work to GitHub and finish my task.
